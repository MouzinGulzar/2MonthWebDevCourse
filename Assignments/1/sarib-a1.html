     <li><b>Cycling:üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</b></li>
     <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen
     ;"><b>Cycling is not just a hobby; it's an adventure. I pedal through life's ups and downs, exploring new paths and embracing the fresh air. It's a way to stay active and connect with the world around me</b></p>
     <li> <b> woodworking: </b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>

As a teenager, I delved into the world of woodworking with boundless enthusiasm. My creations included a diverse range of items ‚Äì from boxes and wooden swords to pet houses, arrows, and decorative pieces. This hands-on journey was not without its challenges; I often bore the marks of many cuts, evidence of my relentless quest for mastery. My trusty toolkit contained a spectrum of cutting tools, such as knives, cutting blade saws, screwdrivers ü™õ, and hammers üî®. So deeply did I immerse myself in my craft that, on many occasions, I found myself working late into the night, even forgetting to eat dinner. Woodworking became a profound part of my teenage years, a passion that I continue to cherish."</b></p>

     <li><b>Electronics  and electrical work:</b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>As a teenager, I found fascination in the world of electronics tinkering and electrical engineering. My hobby revolved around disassembling old electronic devices, from TV sets to radios, and repurposing their components to create new and innovative devices. It was a journey marked by experimentation and innovation, where I learned to work with electrical boards, wires, and circuits. This hobby cultivated my understanding of electrical engineering and ignited a passion for hands-on innovation.</b></p>
     <li><b>mechanical and engineering skills:</b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>In my teenage years, I discovered the world of mechanics and found another hobby to fuel my passion for hands-on work. Day by day, I immersed myself in the intricate art of cycle repair, fine-tuning and restoring bicycles to their former glory. One of the highlights of this journey was building my own custom bicycle by ingeniously combining parts from two different cycles</b></p>
     <li><b>Solitary Evening Walks</b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>

My most cherished hobby is taking solitary evening walks on dark, rainy roads, accompanied by life-affirming songs that touch the soul. In these moments, I find solace, tranquility, and the strength to overcome life's challenges. The soothing rain, the enveloping darkness, and the melodies that resonate with my heart combine to be my sanctuary, helping me confront and conquer the mental struggles that life may bring."</b></p>

     <li><b>Asian Music, EspeciallyKashmiri: </b></li>
 <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>As a passionate enthusiast of Asian music, with a special affection for the rich and melodious tunes of my Kashmiri heritage, my love for these musical traditions runs deep. As a Kashmiri, I've found a profound connection to the captivating melodies of my homeland. Asian music, in all its diversity, offers a journey through different cultures and emotions, making it a harmonious part of my life and a source of immense pride.</b></p>

     <li><b>Writing, Especially Poetry</b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>
"Poetry, an art form that transcends language and touches the soul, has become a cherished hobby in my life. Surprisingly, despite not having an inclination towards Urdu, when I delved into the world of poetry, I found myself captivated by the emotional depth, the richness of words, and the intricate expressions unique to Urdu. To deepen my knowledge and craft my own verses, I turn to platforms like Rekhta, which serve as a wellspring of inspiration and insight. It's through this journey that I've not only discovered the world of poetry but also a profound appreciation for the intricate beauty of the Urdu language.</b></p>
     <li><b>Late-Night Contemplation</b></li>
      <p style="color: green;background-color: lightgreen;"><b>

Sleepless nights, while often considered a challenge, have become an opportunity for me to delve deep into the labyrinth of my thoughts. In the solitude of midnight, I engage in profound self-reflection, contemplating the path my life is on and what I aspire to achieve. It's during these quiet moments that I gain clarity and focus, setting my sights on my goals with a renewed sense of purpose. These late-night musings have become a valuable ally in my journey of self-discovery and personal growth.</b></p>
