      Programming takes a lot of concentration and dedication, and it can be very hectic and stressful to deliver. That is why it is essential to develop a good work-home balance. With the mental exhaustion that comes with programming, programmers may likely burn out if they don’t find a relaxation mechanism.
    <BR>

  One thing that programmers do for fun as a relaxing mechanism is to engage themselves in a hobby. However, it’s improbable that programmers will find themselves doing other things that don’t involve coding, even as a hobby. When you work as a programmer in a competitive environment, it’s normal for the pressure to be high as everyone wants to be the best with their coding languages or algorithms, etc. This is why most programmers spend their leisure time coding or on other related works.
  <BR>
  
  For non-programmers, programming is a lot easier, mainly because of the absence of pressure that programmers face. Even if/when they have programming projects, it’s just for fun. There is no pressure to deliver, no dea.

  It’s a creative and exciting way to learn and create something with the potential of being valuable for these people. The stories of success and instant popularity that come from creating a mobile app are encouraging. Programming also helps to develop connections with people of similar interests. The fact that it changes regularly means that there’s a well of topics to be discussed with new research and ideas.dlines, no competitions, etc. It’s mainly just fun. People who do this for fun can testify.

 " I believe coding is fundamental to literacy in the future."

 " Programming is like any other sport .You might know the rules but you have to play to learn."
